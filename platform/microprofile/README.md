# Trellis Triplestore-based Application

This project generates a deployable Trellis application, using a triplestore for persistence.

The application produced here builds upon [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/),
specifically the [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/) platform.

This project is currently under development with the intention of replacing the
[Dropwizard](https://dropwizard.io)-based application.
