Trellis is a rock-solid, enterprise-ready linked data server.
The quickest way to get started with Trellis is to use
a pre-built [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/trellisldp/trellis).

Trellis is built on existing [Web standards](https://github.com/trellis-ldp/trellis/wiki/Web-Standards).
It is modular, extensible and fast.

## Docker Containers

Docker containers for Trellis are published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/trellisldp).
Container environments are published with every commit to the `main` branch and are available for all stable
releases. More details are available on the
[Trellis Wiki](https://github.com/trellis-ldp/trellis/wiki/Dockerized-Trellis).

Docker pull command

```bash
docker pull trellisldp/trellis-triplestore
```

Or, for the PostgreSQL-based persistence layer

```bash
docker pull trellisldp/trellis-postgresql
```

## Building Trellis

In most cases, you won't need to compile Trellis. Released components are available on Maven Central,
and the deployable application can be [downloaded](https://www.trellisldp.org/download.html) directly
from the Trellis website. However, if you want to build the latest snapshot, you will need, at the very least,
to have Java 11+ available. The software can be built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) using this command:

```bash
./mvnw install
```
